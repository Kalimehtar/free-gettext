# free-gettext
 
This package is an implementation of
[GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html).

It is implemented from scratch
purely in Scheme and thus available with a BSD license. It is also easier to use,
allowing you to optionally load .po files directly without compiling them to .mo files first,
and has many advanced features such as multi-language locales and cascaded message domains.
